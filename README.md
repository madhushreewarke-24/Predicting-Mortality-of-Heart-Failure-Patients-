# Predicting-Mortality-of-Heart-Failure-Patients-
This study applies machine learning to predict mortality in heart failure patients using a dataset of 299 records. SVM and ANN models were trained after data preprocessing. Both performed well, but ANN achieved higher accuracy and F1-score, showing strong potential to support clinicians in identifying high-risk patients early.
